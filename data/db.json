      "body": "Today I am learning how to create a Reactjs website which I am very excited about. It's really amazing how much has changed since the old html page fetch days. Websites are so much more responsive now and less reliant on constant server page requests which really shows in the overall experience. I think this has really helped web applications take off and there is a promising future for serving data this way. I hope I can learn a lot more and create something really interesting!",
